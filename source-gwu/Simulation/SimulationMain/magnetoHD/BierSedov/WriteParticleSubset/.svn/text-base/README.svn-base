This is the standard Sedov test with particles, but is
designed to test writing a particle subset.

Two subsets of the particles array are written.

1. The tags for every single particle.
   Dataset: "Tags_of_all_particles"
2. The full properties of all particles that are at x position > 0.5.
   Dataset: "Posx_greater_than_0.5"


Setup line:
./setup Sedov/WriteParticleSubset -auto +parallelIO
