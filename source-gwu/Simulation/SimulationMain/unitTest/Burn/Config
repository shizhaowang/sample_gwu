#  Configuration file for a burning test (without hydro)
#[source/Simulation/SimulationMain/unitTest/Burn]

#
#  This setup creates a line/square/cube of varying quantities
#  through the domain, then running a burner for one timestep on
#  the resulting domain.
#
#  along the different axes in the domain are:
#  x-axis: the composition from being pure `compA' to pure `compB'
#  y-axis: temperature, from t_min to t_max.
#  z-axis: density, from rho_min to rho_max
#
#  Then one can take one burning step, and verify that the burners
#  are doing The Right Thing.
