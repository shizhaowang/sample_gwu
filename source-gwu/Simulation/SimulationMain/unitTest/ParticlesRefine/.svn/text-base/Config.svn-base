D sim_ptMass mass of one particles when replacing some mass in the
D & domain with active particles to test refinement based on particles
D & count
PARAMETER sim_ptMass     REAL    0.005

D sim_densityThreshold the level of density in any cell above which
D & the particles are used to simulate the mass in the domain. This 
D & formulation is used only to test refinement based on particles.
PARAMETER sim_densityThreshold REAL 0.85

D sim_smlRho the smallest allowed value of density so that we don't
D & have overflow in calculations.
PARAMETER sim_smlRho REAL 1.e-10

D sim_minBlks parameter to ensure that refinement is taking place
PARAMETER sim_minBlks  INTEGER 40

VARIABLE dens #the density profile
VARIABLE dmps #the density distribution where mass carried by particles is removed
VARIABLE pden #the density distribution obtained by mapping particles to mesh
