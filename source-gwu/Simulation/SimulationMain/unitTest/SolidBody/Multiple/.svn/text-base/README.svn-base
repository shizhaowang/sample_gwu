Setup line is
./setup unitTest/SolidBody/Multiple -auto +nofbs -noc -debug -objdir=multiple_solid_body

This unit test creates 4000 solid bodies that is distributed randomly over 4
processors. The exchange routine (named Grid_updateSolidBodyForces)
sends the appropriate particles to the processor that contains the LEAF
block which covers the particle.  The receiving processor then
sets the particles' PROC_PART_PROP element to its processor ID.  The
updated particles sends back to the master allowing the
processor ID check in Grid_solidBodyUnitTest test to succeed.

Note that the exchange is not needed in a single processor unit test.
Set iprocs = jprocs = 1 in the flash.par.
