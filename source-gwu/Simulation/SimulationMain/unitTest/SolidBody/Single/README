Setup line is
./setup unitTest/SolidBody/Single -auto +nofbs -noc -debug -objdir=solid_body

This unit test creates 1 solid body that is distributed over 2 of 4
processors. The exchange routine (named Grid_updateSolidBodyForces)
sends the appropriate particles to the processor that contains the LEAF
block which covers the particle.  The receiving processor then
sets the particles' PROC_PART_PROP element to its processor ID.  The
updated particles sends back to the master allowing the
processor ID check in Grid_solidBodyUnitTest test to succeed.


The debug output below shows that global PE 1 is the solid body
master.  It becomes the master because its LEAF blocks have the most
overlap with the single solid body.  Global PE 2 and 3 have no overlap
and so are not part of this solid body communicator.  Global PE 1
creates particles within the solid body space.
