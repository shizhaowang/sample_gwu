This is the original PFFT test.

In order for this test to succeed we have provided a custom
Grid_solvePoisson.  We have used the same Grid_solvePoisson as was in
trunk at version 9289.  We have done this because this test is not a
standard finite difference problem (as is currently handled by the PFFT
solver).

Marcos mentioned that this test may be a spectral problem because the
solutions at the end of the unit test are exceptionally good, e.g:

 Processor 0 the result is T 7.993605777301127E-15 7.993605777301127E-15
     Returned from Grid_unitTest
 Processor 1 the result is T 1.421085471520200E-14 1.421085471520200E-14
     Returned from Grid_unitTest
 Processor 2 the result is T 1.421085471520200E-14 1.421085471520200E-14

You would never get solutions this good when approximating a function
on a finite-differenced grid!

What shall we do with this test???
