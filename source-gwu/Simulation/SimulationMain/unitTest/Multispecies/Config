#            BIG similar to SF6
#            ZERO has a nasty zero value for Z = numPositive, and <1 for GAMMA
#            NEG has a nasty negative value for both Z and GAMMA
# This test does not use Grid -- it also therefore tests stub implementations

# in the setup script to ensure the species name does not 
# exceed 4 characters.  Apparently, Paramesh only works
