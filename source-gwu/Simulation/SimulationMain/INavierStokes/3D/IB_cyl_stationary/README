This directory contains the data and routines for flow around a circular cylinder at Re = 100.
This simulation is modified from the case IB_RotCyl_Black.
- The stationary cylinder is set by modifying the kinematics in the bodyinfo.
- The initial field has an uniform flow along y direction.

- To setup a Uniform Grid calculation use IB_cyl_stationary_ug.sh 
  in the base dir of FLASH and copy MANUALLY the files from
  this simulation directory:
  flash_ug.par -> OBJDIR/flash.par
  sm_body.00001_stationary_ug.h5 -> OBJDIR/sm_body.00001.h5

- To setup an AMR calculation use IB_cyl_stationary_amr.sh 
  in the base dir of FLASH and copy MANUALLY the files from
  this simulation directory:
  flash_amr.par -> OBJDIR/flash.par
  sm_body.00001_stationary_amr.h5 -> OBJDIR/sm_body.00001.h5
