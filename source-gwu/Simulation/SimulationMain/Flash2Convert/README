Notes to myself first, eventually put together something publishable.

Files that have to be set for a successful conversion:

Config must include grid quantities for the run we want, not included with
units we have set up with.
Would it be enough to include just the units we are looking for.

You need to have a good flash2vars file. The script in tools should help

flash2parts will be needed for particle mapping.
Particles don't work yet.
