The Noh Problem
===============

Introduction
------------

The Noh problem (Journal of Computational Physics, No.72, p.78)
tests a hydrocodes ability to convert kinetic energy to internal energy.
A uniform velocity cold ideal gas converges towards the origin
and creates an outward moving shock from the origin that stagnates the 
incomming gas.


Comments concerning the FLASH implementation of the Noh problem
---------------------------------------------------------------

A uniform mesh is used in the calculations because AMR produced
refinement everywhere in the spatial domain instead of only at
the shock. It is not recommended to use AMR for this problem at
this time.

The .par file requires the user to create a subdirectory to store
the checkpoint and par file. See the specific .par file to
determine the name of this subdirectory. The code will exit
with an error if this subdirectory does not exist.

The crun.pl script performs a convergence study and makes plots.
This perl script requires idl to extract data from the resulting
checkpoint files. In order to run the crun.pl script, do the following:

1) Run FLASH setup: ./setup Noh -1d -auto -geometry=spherical -maxblocks=10000 -objdir=Noh

2) Compile FLASH:

cd Noh
make
mkdir dumps

3) Copy crun.pl, ildrun, *.pro to your object directory and plot_rates.pl, *.m to your dumps subdirectory

4) Edit crun.pl to specificy the proper path to idl

5) Run crun.pl: ./crun.pl

6) Run plot_rates.pl:

cd dumps
./plot_rates.pl
