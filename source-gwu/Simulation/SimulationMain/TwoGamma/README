Notes by Alan Calder, 2006, and by Lynn Reid, 2007 after email discussion with Alan

This setup is for a simple test of advecting two fluids
having different gammas. The goal is to investigate whether
or not an instability develops at the interface between
the two fluids (Abgrall and Karni, JCP 169, 594 (2001)). 

What happens is that if you start out with two materials
of different gamma with a flat interface between them and
propagate that across the grid, numerical mixing as the
interface propagates across multiple zones leads to
unphysical behavior. Numerical mixing is always a problem
and an interface propagating across the mesh without some
sort of interface tracking method will get diffuse. But
this two gamma example is worse than just that, the resulting
mixed zones are not just a diffuse mixture. Instead,
something weird.  Right now this Simulation demonstrates
a problem without providing a solution.

Preliminary results were at
http://fleetwood.asci.uchicago.edu/~calder/validation/twogamma/
but have disappeared with Alan's computer when he lefet.

Please do not take them to mean that we completely understand 
what is going on. The purpose of this setup is to investigate
the issue.

Here is an email exchange between Alan Calder and Eduard Kirr, 
who was a postdoc with Todd Dupont and possibly Vikram.
