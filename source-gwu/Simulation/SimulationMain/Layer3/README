The problem in this setup directory is that of an intense
laser hitting a 3-layer target of decreasing density. The
three materials in the target are copper, CH plastic, and 
C-foam. The first interface, between the copper and plastic
has a sinusoidal perturbation, and this perturbation is
imprinted on the shock that passes through the interface. As
the shock propagates toward the second interface, the perturbation
oscillates. When the shock hits the second interface, it
is almost planar, but the perturbation is still imprinted on
to the interface. The interfaces are subject to fluid instabitlites
resulting from the passage of the shock, and instability growth
(fingers of copper and bubbles of C-foam) may is observed.

To run the problem, set up the problem and compile the code
as usual. By default the problem is set up as a 2-d problem.
Copy the executable from the object directory and the files 
"flash.par" and "3lay_1d.dat" found in the setup directory
to the directory in which you want to run the problem and it
should be ready to go. The simulation is set to run only 100
steps (for testing) but setting
