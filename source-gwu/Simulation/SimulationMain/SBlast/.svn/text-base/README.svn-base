Scripts:
========

To install the scripts do the following:

-Copy the contents of oscripts to your object directory
-Copy all .par files to your object directory
-Make a dumps subdirectory in your object directory; checkpoint and plotfiles will be dumped there
-Copy the contents of dscripts to your dumps subdirectory

Parameter Space
===============

The current parameter space has been included into this setup:

Physical geometry:
------------------

1d: planar, cylindrical, spherical

2d: cylindrical, spherical

3d: spherical


Mesh geometry:
--------------

1d: cartesian, cylindrical, spherical

2d: cartesian, cylindrical, polar, spherical

3d: cartesian


Atmospherical conditions:
-------------------------

-Constant desnity,
-Exponential decay density, constant pressure


Source conditions:
------------------

-Constant density, constant pressure


Misc comments:
--------------

The original intent of this class of problems was to verify the behavior
of FLASH 3 in various physical geometries, mesh geometries, and initial
conditions. Unforunately, due to time to time contraints, much of this
effort has to be abandoned at this time. Initial conditions that included
uniform gravity has been discontinued. The filed suffixed with .old contain
some hints to the original effort.
