This subdirectory lets us test whether the data movement to and from
PFFT grid is correct.  The FFT is not carried out!

Setup line:
./setup PoisTest/PFFT -auto -2d

It is a good test for PFFT as the refinement level of the grid varies
significantly.  This allows us to test whether data movement is
correct for any specified refinement level from 1 to
MAX_COMMON_REFINEMENT.  Here, MAX_COMMON_REFINEMENT is the result of
Grid_getMaxCommonRefinement().

We use a modified version of:
Grid/GridSolvers/Multigrid/PfftTopLevelSolve/gr_hgSolve.F90.  Our
version simply moves data from FLASH grid to PFFT grid, and back
again, with no FFT.


In future
---------

When the FFT is correctly working in PFFT we can setup the standard
PoisTest using:

./setup PoisTest -auto -2d
--with-unit=Grid/GridSolvers/Multigrid/PfftTopLevelSolve

This should give identical results to the standard Poistest with the
intended setup (includes the standard Multigrid solver):

./setup PoisTest -auto -2d
