# When using UG, iProcs, jProcs and kProcs must be specified.
# These are the processors along each of the dimensions
# FIXEDBLOCKSIZE mode ::
#	When using fixed blocksize, iGridSize etc are redundant in
#	runtime parameters. These quantities are calculated as 
#	iGridSize = NXB*iprocs
#	jGridSize = NYB*jprocs
#	kGridSize = NZB*kprocs
# NONFIXEDBLOCKSIZE mode ::
#	iGridSize etc must be specified. They constitute the global
#	number of grid points in the physical domain without taking 
#	the guard cell into account. The local blocksize is calculated
#	as iGridSize/iprocs  etc.
