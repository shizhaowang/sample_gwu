No idea what this stuff means.
I _think_ "Todd's data" was generating the initial conditions
!
!
!  Todd's data was computed with an axisymmetric code and each variable
!    is written to a file.  Coordinates are not written to any file.
!    Data location in the cell is:
!      at cell centers: rho, p, SF6 mass fraction, SF6 mole fraction
!      centered in z, at edge in r: radial velocity
!      at edge in z, centered in r: vertical velocity
!    For an (nr,nz) grid, there are
!      (nr,nz) cell centered points
!      (nr-1,nz) radial velocity points
!      (nr,nz-1) vertical velocity points
!    Compared to the flash simulations, the axisymmetric simulations
!      are on a much coarser grid.
