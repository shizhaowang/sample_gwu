Cal,
You can look in flash/shockcyl-release.  There are lots of directories
there, some run directories with data, some with code, and some with
initial conditions stuff.
                                                                                                                     
For the runs, those initialized with Todd's profiles start with rz_.
The next number is the highest resolution (dx)  in micrometers. Third
is the profile identifier, e.g. 128x64u, which means Todd's case
128x64u, 128 is points in z and 64 is points radial, and u is just case
u, which corresponds to a particular inlet mass fraction and average
velocity.  The cases are described in flash/shockcyl_ic/cases.  Next,
it says 5.5cm which means it was a 2d run and I extracted the profile
from Todd's data at z=5.5cm, the image plane in the experiment.  For 3d
cases there is no _5.5cm.    _vc0 means the simulation is is in the
cylinder frame, which I just did by just putting in a background
velocity (vx_amb), and the next number is the length (in x) of the
domain in cm.  If there is no number, it is 60cm, the same as for the
fixed frame simulations.
uniform and cfl= are self explanatory; default is adaptive grid and
cfl=0.2.
                                                                                                                     
About the profiles.  In the flash.par for the rz_ runs, there are
parameters sf6_file_cc, press_file_cc, rvel_file_ec, and zvel_file_ce,
which are set to the names of the files containing that data. (cc=>
variable is associated with center in x, center in y in the cell. ec =>
edge in x, center in y.)  The zvel is not used in 2d, and I think the
pressure is not used in 2d or 3d.  But I still put the data files
there, I'm pedantic.  The files themselves are just the output from
Todd's code, renamed. So e.g. 128x64l_sf6 is identical to
massfr_0xxxxxx for Todd's run 128x64l, where the xxxxx is the highest
iteration number (last time step) for Todd's run.  All the data is in
the case-named directory in flash/shockcyl_ic.

     ! cc refers to centered in r, centered in z    cell-centered variables
     ! ce refers to centered in r, edge in z        vertical (z) velocity
     ! ec refers to edge in r, centered in z        radial velocity

                                                                                                                     
I have more run data scattered around tawari and other machines, but
you should be able to set up what you need from the examples in
flash/shockcyl-release/rz_.....
