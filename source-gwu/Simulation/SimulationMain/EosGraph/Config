# A really simple setup that writes a couple of files,
# EOSdumpE.dat and EOSdumpP.dat, for graphing the
# E(T) and p(T) behavior of the Helmholtz Eos implementation.
# Output is appropriate for gnuplot or any similar plotting
# utility.
#
# This version also produces columns for (in order) ion, electron,
# and radiation components of internal energy and pressure.
# It needs 'multiTemp' extensions of the Eos for this.
#
# Sample setup line:
#   ./setup -auto EosGraph +noio +ug -1d
