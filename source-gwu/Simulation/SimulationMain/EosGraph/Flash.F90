!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  The source file Flash.F90 in the Simulation unit contains the Fortran
!!  PROGRAM. As such it can be considered the top-level "driver" of an application.
!!  By default it is set up to drive the simulation of a time-dependent
!!  problem by calling:
!!  - Driver_initFlash  for initializations,
!!  - Driver_evolveFlash  for managing the computation, and
!!  - Driver_finalizeFlash  for cleaning up.
