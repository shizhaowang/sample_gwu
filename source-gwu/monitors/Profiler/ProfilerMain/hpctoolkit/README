We can sample FLASH evolution only by setting up FLASH with
-unit=monitors/Profiler/ProfilerMain/hpctoolkit

When running this application we must tell hpcrun to initially turn
off sampling (it is on by default): use the -ds (or --delay-sampling)
option for hpcrun (dynamic) or set the HPCRUN_DELAY_SAMPLING
environment variable (static).


Background
----------

HPCToolkit supports an API for the application to start and stop
sampling. This is useful if the application wants to profile only a
subset of the program and ignore the rest.  This interface is process
wide, not thread specific. And technically, when sampling is turned
off, hpcrun continues to receive interrupts, but it doesnâ€™t unwind the
call stack or record samples. This API supports the following
functions.

void hpctoolkit_sampling_start(void);
void hpctoolkit_sampling_stop(void);

To use this interface, put the above function calls into your program
where you want sampling to start and stop. Remember, starting and
stopping apply process wide.
