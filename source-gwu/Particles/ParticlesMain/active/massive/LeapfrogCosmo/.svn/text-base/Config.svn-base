#  Mesh-based solution variables needed for active particles.

#  In principle this is needed only for particle-mesh-type applications,
#  but things tend to go horribly wrong when there are no mesh-based
#  variables defined in the code, so we put this at the top level of the
#  active particle sub-unit to make sure there's always at least one.
#  In any case some mesh variable is practically necessary in order to
#  do mesh refinement, which is needed (if for nothing else) to keep the
#  particles storage-balanced on parallel machines.

#  The pden mesh variable receives mesh-mapped versions of particle
#  quantities (e.g., particle_mass).

VARIABLE pden TYPE: PER_VOLUME # particle density
