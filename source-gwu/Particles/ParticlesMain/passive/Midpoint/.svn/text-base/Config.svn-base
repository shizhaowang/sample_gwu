D pos2PrevX  x-position at the previous time minus 1; an intermediate result and should not be used
D pos2PrevY  y-position at the previous time minus 1; an intermediate result and should not be used
D pos2PrevZ  z-position at the previous time minus 1; an intermediate result and should not be used
