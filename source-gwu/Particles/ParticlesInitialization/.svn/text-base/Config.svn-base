# Initialization methods of spatial distribution for tracer particles
# [source/Particles/ParticlesInitialization]

# Submodules:

#   WithDensity      Distribute the particles randomly, using the gas density as the
#                    distribution function.
#   Lattice          Distribute the particles on a uniform lattice.
