# Runtime Parameters common to the implementations:

D pt_numParticlesWanted     Number of tracer particles to use (not guaranteed to get exactly this many)
D pt_pRand                  A number which affects the initial seed for the random number generator.
D &                         We set the default value to 1 to make it more likely that the initial
D &                         seed is within the integer range given by the IBM XL documentation which
D &                         is "A valid seed must be a whole number between 1.0 and 2147483647.0
D &                         (2.0**31-1)", as long as the number of MPI tasks is less than that value.
 
PARAMETER pt_numParticlesWanted INTEGER  100
PARAMETER pt_pRand            INTEGER  1
