!! NAME
!!
!!  gr_mpoleCen2Dspherical
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  gr_mpoleCen2Dspherical (integer, intent(in) :: idensvar)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Computes all data related to the center of multipole expansion for 2D spherical
!!  geometry. It computes the center of expansion for the multipoles for 2D spherical
!!  geometries. The center is calculated using the position weighted by the square
!!  density:
!!
!!
!!                          integral (r * rho * rho  dr)
!!                Cen (z) = ----------------------------
!!                            integral (rho * rho  dr)
!!
!!
!!  which, due to uniform density in each cell, becomes:
!!
!!
!!                   sum cells (cell center r * cell mass * cell rho)
!!         Cen (z) = ------------------------------------------------
!!                           sum cells (cell mass * cell rho)
!!
!!
!!  After the initial Cen (z) has been determined, it is placed on the nearest
!!  nearest cell corner. The following is computed here:
!!
!!                  1) multipole expansion center (placed on nearest cell corner)
!!                  2) total mass (aborts, if <= 0)
!!                  3) the 'atomic' inner zone length (and its inverse)
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  idensvar : the index of the density variable
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  gr_mpoleZcenter denotes the location of the center of multipole expansion
!!  in the 2D cartesian version of the 2D spherical framework (R,theta -> x,z).
!!  Due to symmetry, there is no need to evaluate and store a x-coordinate
!!  component, which is always equal to zero.

!             Here the convention used in FLASH is to store the Rsph values into the
!             i-index (FLASH x-axis) and the angular theta values (in radians) into
!             the j-index (FLASH y-axis). Due to symmetry, the center of mass only
!             has a radial component and must have theta = 0.
!
!             The cell volume is:
!
!                      (2/3) * pi * (R^3 - r^3) * (cos[t] - cos[T])
!
!             where
!                       r  =  left-most (smaller) radial cell distance
!                       R  =  right-most (larger) radial cell distance
!                       t  =  smaller cell angle
!                       T  =  larger cell angle
!
!             The above formula can be obtained from the simple formula for a spherical
!             cone and noting that the cell can be obtained by adding and subtracting
!             the appropriate spherical cones. The cell looks like a torus with a 2D polar
!             cell cross-sectional shape. Since our angular and radial measures are based
!             on the 2D polar cell's center, we have:
!
!                       r  =  Rsph - Dr/2
!                       R  =  Rsph + Dr/2
!                       t  =  theta - Dt/2
!                       T  =  theta + Dt/2
!
!             with Dt and Dr being the cell's angular and radial delta value.
!             Hence the cell volume becomes, after using some trig identities:
!
!               (4pi * (Rsph)^2 * Dr + (pi/3) * Dr^3) * sin[Dt/2] * sin[theta]
!
!             Note, that the 'cartesian' center of multipole expansion coordinates
!             are obtained. This 'cartesian' framework is solely used to facilitate
!             computations in the spherical framework, especially if the center of
!             multipole expansion shifts away from the spherical domain origin.
!             The two frameworks are related via:
!
!                           x = Rsph * sin (theta)
!                           z = Rsph * cos (theta)
!
!             with the y-cartesian direction being covered by the implicitly assumed
!             symmetry around the z-axis. The center of multipole expansion must be
!             along the z-axis (i.e. have theta = 0 for z >= 0 or theta = pi for z < 0)
!             due to the assumed symmetry around the z-axis.
!
!             The recursions for evaluating the sine and cosine functions for angles
!             which increase by a fixed amount are taken from the Numerical Recipies.
