D mg_maxCorrections      Maximum number of correction V-cycles to employ.
D mg_maxResidualNorm    Apply V-cycle corrections until this residual norm
D &                       is reached or mg_maxCorrections V-cycles have been
D &                       performed.
D mg_printNorm        If .true., print the ratio of the residual norm to
D &                       the source norm as each V-cycle is completed.
D quadrant              True if only one quadrant is being calculated in 2-d cylindrical coordinates
