!! NAME
!!  gr_hgSetMaxLevel
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!   gr_hgSetMaxLevel(integer, intent(in):: level)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!  
!!  Reworks the nodetypes(:) array in paramesh such that blocks of
!!  lrefine = level are leaves, as well as leaves above level.  
!!  This then resets Paramesh to believe that this is the entire mesh.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!  
!!  level - the level that is set as the max level in paramesh
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  This routine's work used to be done by gr_hgBndry; however this was
!!  called far too often to be efficient; the dataflow was also convoluted,
!!  It was moved here for these reasons.
!!
!!  We can define CAUTIOUS_PARAMESH_CALL to use the more expensive
!!  amr_morton_process().  We have run more tests using this call with 
!!  Multigrid.
