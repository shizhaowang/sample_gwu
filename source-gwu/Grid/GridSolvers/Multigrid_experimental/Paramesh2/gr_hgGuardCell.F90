!! NAME
!!  gr_hgGuardCell
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  gr_hgGuardCell(integer, intent(in) :: myPE,
!!                 integer, intent(in) :: nlayers,
!!                 logical, intent(in) :: extrap)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  This routine fills the guardcells in the work variable, and 
!!  sets the external boundaries appropriately.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  myPE    - the current processor
!!  nlayers - the number of layers to fill
!!  extrap  - extrapolate the cell values into the outer boundaries
!!              .false. => fill the boundary as if it goes to zero
!!              .true.  => extrapolate the interior cell values outwards
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  calling amr_guardcell with inadequate numbers of layers to fill creates 
!!  problems with monotonic interpolation.  The fix below echoes that of
!!  paramesh4 Grid_fillGuardcells.

!!  nlayers must be an even number for monotonic interpolation,
