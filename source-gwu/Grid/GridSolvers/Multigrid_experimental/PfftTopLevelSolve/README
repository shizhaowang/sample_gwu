Setup using:
 -with-unit=Grid/GridSolvers/Multigrid_experimental/PfftTopLevelSolve

We provide a custom implementation of gr_hgSolve which 
is the glue between the Ricker(+Brune) multigrid solver and 
the PFFT solver.  It contains calls to 
initialise the PFFT grid, perform the PFFT FFT, and 
deallocate the PFFT grid.

We need to use the Multigrid_experimental version of Grid_solvePoisson.  
There is a line like the following in Grid/GridSolvers/Config 
to force setup to choose the right Grid_solvePoisson:
CHILDORDER Pfft Multigrid...
