Setup using:
 -with-unit=Grid/GridSolvers/Multigrid/PfftTopLevelSolve

We provide a custom implementation of gr_hgSolve which 
is the glue between the Ricker multigrid solver and 
the PFFT solver.  It contains calls to 
initialise the PFFT grid, perform the PFFT FFT, and 
deallocate the PFFT grid.

We need to use the Multigrid version of Grid_solvePoisson.  
There is the following edit in Grid/GridSolvers/Config 
to force setup to choose Multigrid's Grid_solvePoisson:
CHILDORDER Pfft Multigrid
