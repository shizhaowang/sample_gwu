#Config file for Grid/GridBoundaryConditions/Flash3HSE

# We use the runmtime parameters "gconst" and "gdirec" defined
# in the GravityMain/Constant Config file.  We currently don't
# use any of the actual code of that Gravity implementation,
# so in principle a simulation can choose to define these runtime
# parameters in its own Config file and would then not need to
# include GravityMain/Constant. That is the reason why we use
# REQUESTS but not REQUIRES here.
