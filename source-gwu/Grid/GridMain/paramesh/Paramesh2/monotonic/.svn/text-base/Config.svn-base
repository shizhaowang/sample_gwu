# These symbols may not actually be used by any code when
# compiling with Paramesh2, but they are defined here anyway
# to parallel the Paramesh3 case.

# Define a symbol to signal that monotonic interpolation
# routines are compiled in:
PPDEFINE GRID_WITH_MONOTONIC

# Define a symbol to signal that guardcell layers can
# only be given in multiples of two:
PPDEFINE GRID_GC_LAYERS_ALWAYS_EVEN
