# By defining PM_UNIQUE_MPI_TAGS, we tell this PARAMESH implementation
# to reproduce the old logic by which in various places, individual
# MPI messages are given uniquely identifying tags based on processor
# and block numbers. This seems to prevent occasional deadlocks observed
# in Paramesh4.0 with high optimization levels. On the other hand, tags
# generated with PM_UNIQUE_MPI_TAG may exceed the maximum allowed tag
# values of some MPI implementations.
