!! NAME
!!  Grid_getSingleCellCoords
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  Grid_getSingleCellCoords(integer(in)       ::  ind(MDIM), 
!!                           integer(in)       ::  blockid,
!!                           integer(in)       ::  edge,
!!                           integer(in)       ::  beginCount,
!!                           real(OUT)         ::  coords(MDIM))
!!  
!! DESCRIPTION 
!!
!!  Returns the coordinates of a single cell of a given block.
!!
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  ind - array holding the indices of the cell whose coordinates to return
!! 
!!  blockid - local block number
!!
!!  edge - indicates if user wants the left, center or right edge of the block
!!         options are LEFT_EDGE, RIGHT_EDGE, or CENTER.  These constants are
!!         defined in constants.h
!!
!!
!!  beginCount : tells the routine where to start index counting.  beginCount can
!!               be set to INTERIOR or EXTERIOR.  If INTERIOR is specified
!!               guardcell indices are not included and index 1 is the first interior cell. 
!!               If EXTERIOR is specified
!!               the first index, 1, is the left most guardcell.  See example
!!               below for more explanation.  (For most of the FLASH architecture code,
!!               we use EXTERIOR.  Some physics routines, however, find it helpful 
!!               only to work on the internal parts of the blocks (without
!!               guardcells) and wish to keep loop indicies  
!!               going from 1 to NXB without having to worry about finding 
!!               the correct offset for the number of guardcells.) 
!!               (INTERIOR and EXTERIOR are defined in constants.h)
!!
!!
!!    
!!  coords : returned coordinates of the specificed cell
!!
