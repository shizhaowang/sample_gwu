!! NAME
!!
!!  Grid_initDomain
!!
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Grid_initDomain(logical(IN)  :: restart,
!!                       logical(INOUT) :: particlesInitialized)
!!
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!! 
!!  Create the mesh, initialize all the mesh data structures
!!  and apply initial conditions
!!
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  restart : is true if the execution is starting from a checkpoint
!!            file, otherwise false.
!!  particlesInitialized : is true if particle positions were initialized before returning
!!                         from this routine
