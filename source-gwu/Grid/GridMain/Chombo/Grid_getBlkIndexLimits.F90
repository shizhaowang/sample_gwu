!!  Grid_getBlkIndexLimits
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Grid_getBlkIndexLimits(integer(IN)  :: blockId,
!!                              integer(OUT) :: blkLimits(2,MDIM),
!!                              integer(OUT) :: blkLimitsGC(2,MDIM),
!!                     optional,integer(IN)  :: gridDataStruct)
!!  
!! DESCRIPTION 
!!  
!! Returns the indicies of the upper and lower bounds of a block.
!! blkLimitsGC holds the entire dimension of the block (including guardcells)
!! blkLimits returns the indicies of the interior of the block. 
!!
!! The first dimension holds the lower and upper bounds of the block.
!! The second dimension is of size MDIM to hold the upper and lower 
!! indicies of each dimension.  
!!
!! This routine is also used to calculate the size of the internal 
!! index size of a block.  In FLASH2, this was simply NXB, NYB and NZB.
!! In FLASH3, since we are supporting blocksizes that are not fixed you 
!! should calculate on the size of the block on a per block basis.  See
!! example below.
!!  
!! Please note that the face centered variables have an extra data point 
!! along the corresponding dimension. For example variable centered on the
!! faces along IAXIS dimension have equivalent of NXB+1 data points in the
!! interior. If the optional argument gridDataStruct is specified, and it
!! is one of the face-centered data structures, the values returned in the
!! the two output arrays will reflect the additional data point. Since most
!! of FLASH applications use only cell centered variable, most users need not
!! concern themselves with this argument.
!!
!!
!! ARGUMENTS 
!!
!!  blockId - the local blockID
!!  blkLimits  -  array retuned holding the upper and lower indicies of 
!!             the interior of a block (no guardcells!)
!!             
!!  blkLimitsGC  -  array returned holding the upper and lower indicies
!!             of an entire block, that is including guardcells
!!  gridDataStruct - Grid data structure being operated on, the valid
!!                   values are CENTER, FACEX, FACEY and FACEZ. Specifying
!!                   gridDataStructure= CENTER is equivalent to not including the
!!                   optional argument in the call.
!!             
!! EXAMPLE
!! 
!!  Take a 2 dimensional block of size NXB x NYB, with ghost cells along
!!  each dimension being GX and GY.  This block could be stored in an array of 
!!  size (NXB+2*GX,NYB+2*GY). For this array the returned values of blkLimits and blkLimitsGC
!!  are as follows.
!!
!!  blkLimitsGC(LOW, IAXIS) = 1 !lower bound index of the first cell in the entire block in xdir
!!  blkLimitsGC(LOW, JAXIS) = 1
!!  blkLimitsGC(LOW, KAXIS) = 1
!!
!!  blkLimitsGC(HIGH, IAXIS) = NXB+2*GX !upper bound index of the last cell in the entire block in xdir
!!  blkLimitsGC(HIGH, JAXIS) = NYB +2*GY
!!  blkLimitsGC(HIGH, KAXIS) = 1 !because there are only 2 dimensions
!!
!!
!!  blkLimits(LOW, IAXIS) = GX+1 !lower bound index of the first interior cell of a block in xdir
!!  blkLimits(LOW, JAXIS) = GY+1 
!!  blkLimits(LOW, KAXIS) = 1
!!
!!  blkLimits(HIGH, IAXIS) = NXB+GX !the upper bound index of the last interior cell of a block in xdir
!!  blkLimits(HIGH, JAXIS) = NYB+GY
!!  blkLimits(HIGH, KAXIS) = 1 !because there are only 2 dimensions
!!
!!  For the same block, if the Optional argument was present and was FACEX, then
!!  blkLimits(HIGH,IAXIS)=NXB+1, and blkLimitsGC(HIGH,IAXIS)=NXB+1+2*GX, and 
!!  all other values of blkLimits and blkLimitsGC are the same as those of the
!!  default case. Similarly if optional argument had a value FACEY, then
!!  blkLimits(HIGH,JAXIS)=NYB+1, and blkLimitsGC(HIGH,JAXIS)=NYB+1+2*GY, and
!!  all others are same as before. 
!!
!!
!!  To calculate NXB, NYB and NZB for a given block
!!
!!  NXB = blkLimits(HIGH,IAXIS) - blkLimits(LOW,IAXIS) +1
!!  NYB = blkLimits(HIGH,JAXIS) - blkLimits(LOW,JAXIS) +1
!!  NZB = blkLimits(HIGH,KAXIS) - blkLimits(LOW,KAXIS) +1
!!
!!
!! NOTES
!!  
!!   The #define constants IAXIS, JAXIS and KAXIS
!!   are defined in constants.h and are
!!   meant to ease the readability of the code.       
!!   instead of blkLimits(HIGH,3)  the code reads
!!   blkLimits(HIGH, KAXIS)
