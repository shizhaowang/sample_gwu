In this unit test we create a 2d distributed uniform grid that is
decomposed along the IAXIS across 4 processors.  We have periodic
boundary conditions and 1 block per processor that contains 2
variables (components).  Each processor initializes the local grid
points for each variable to a unique value.  After a guard cell
exchange we compare the values in the local grid points against known
values and check for correctness.

The Makefile will create soft links to some FLASH subroutines and
chombo wrapper functions in the main source tree before building the
source files.  This allows us to test many key subroutines and
functions independently of large FLASH applications.

Build and run the test by typing
$ make all

All of the heavy lifting including:
  1) storing grid data
  2) providing information about the size of the local grid on each
  processor
  3) filling guard cells
is done by Chombo library.
