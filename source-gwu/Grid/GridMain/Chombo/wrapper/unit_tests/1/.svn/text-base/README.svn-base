Three layers:

FLASH (Fortran 2003)
Language interface (C++ without name decoration)
Chombo interface (C++)


Some notes:

This test allocates a contiguous array in C++ using malloc, and then
initializes the array with values 0,1,2,3 ..., 23 in contiguous memory
locations in C++.  We use Fortran 2003 features to obtain a pointer to
the address of the first element of the allocated memory.  Then in
Fortran we construct a Fortran 90 4D pointer object from the raw
memory address.  Finally, we iterate through the contiguous memory
locations in Fortran and check that we pick up the anticipated values
in the 4D array.

The language interface file contains a collection of functions that
operate on a chombo interface object.  These functions are given C
linkage so that they can be called by Fortran.  The initialization
function (called by FLASH's driver_init_flash) allocates a chombo
interface object on the heap, and then a finalization function (called
by FLASH's driver_finalize_flash) frees this object.  This way all
Chombo data / metadata stays in scope whilst we are in FLASH's
driver_evolve_flash.


The chombo interface file contains an object that will eventually
interact with the chombo library.
