REQUIRES IO/IOTypes/hdf5

D packMeshPlotWriteHDF5 If true, this specifies that we pack the 
D plot file data into a contiguous buffer before performing the data write.
D This is only applicable to HDF5 I/O implementation in experimental mode.  
D This is because the HDF5 group try to avoid data copies at all costs even
D if it means missing out on optimisations, such as collective I/O.   It 
D applies to experimental mode only which uses datatypes to pick up data, and 
D not standard mode which already packs the data.  This option packs the 
D data described by the datatype in the same way as pnetcdf, which costs more 
D memory, but allows usage of collective I/O.  Default value is true.

PARAMETER packMeshPlotWriteHDF5 BOOLEAN true

D Same as packMeshPlotWriteHDF5 except for checkpoint files writes.
PARAMETER packMeshChkWriteHDF5 BOOLEAN false

D Same as packMeshPlotWriteHDF5 except for checkpoint files read.
PARAMETER packMeshChkReadHDF5 BOOLEAN false
