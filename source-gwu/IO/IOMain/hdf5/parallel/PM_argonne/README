This I/O implementation was originally designed for PARAMESH, however,
it should support UG and NOFBS (although this is tested less).

Setup lines:

PARAMESH: ./setup Sedov -auto -unit=IO/IOMain/hdf5/parallel/PM_argonne +pm4dev
UG: ./setup Sedov -auto +ug -unit=IO/IOMain/hdf5/parallel/PM_argonne
NOFBS: ./setup Sedov -auto -nofbs +ug -unit=source/IO/IOMain/hdf5/parallel/PM_argonne

Add particle I/O: ... -unit=IO/IOParticles/hdf5/parallel
WARNING: THE DEFAULT PARTICLE I/O IS SERIAL!!!
