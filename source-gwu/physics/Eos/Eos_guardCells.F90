!! NAME
!!
!!  Eos_guardCells
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Eos_guardCells(integer(IN)  :: eosmode,
!!                      integer(IN)  :: blockid,
!!                      logical(IN)  :: corners,
!!             optional,integer(IN)  :: layers(MDIM))
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Another layer of wrapping around Eos_wrapped calls, provided
!!  as a convenience to make it easy to apply the EOS to guard cells only.
!!  
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  eosmode : determines which variables are used as Eos input variables.
!!            The valid values are MODE_DENS_EI (where density and internal
!!            energy are inputs), MODE_DENS_PRES (density and pressure as inputs)
!!            MODE_DENS_TEMP (density and temperature are inputs).
!!            These quantities are defined in constants.h.
!!            The argument is passed unchanged and unexamined to Eos_wrapped calls.
!!
!!  blockid : ID of block in current processor
!!
!!  corners : indicates whether Eos should be called on corner
!!            guard cells (i.e., diagonal guard cells)
!!  layers  : the number of guard cells to be included along each dimension
!!
!! SEE ALSO
!!  Eos_wrapped
