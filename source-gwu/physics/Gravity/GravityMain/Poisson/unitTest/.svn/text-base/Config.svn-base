REQUIRES physics/Gravity/GravityMain/Poisson

# NOTE!  Because the unitTest is at the same level as the Poisson solver, none of the solvers
#  get picked up.  You MUST do ./setup unitTest/Poisson3 -auto -with-unit=phyics/Grid/GridMain/Poisson/Multipole -3d 
#  (or something like that)



VARIABLE apot           # analytical solution for potential, initial condition
VARIABLE errm		# analytical minus calculated potential 
VARIABLE errd	        # analytical divided by calculated potential
VARIABLE errn	        # analytical minus calculated potential, divided by analytical potential
