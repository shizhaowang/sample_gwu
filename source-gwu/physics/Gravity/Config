D grav_boundary_type Type of gravitational boundary condition if a Poisson solve
D           &        is used for Gravity; string-valued version of grav_boundary.
D           &        Accepts:
D           &        "isolated", "periodic", "dirichlet", and maybe others,
D           &        depending on the Poisson solver used.
D           &        This is declared in the stub level of the Gravity unit
D           &        to allow the Grid unit to refer to this runtime parameter
D           &        even when no Gravity implementation is included.
PARAMETER grav_boundary_type STRING "isolated"
