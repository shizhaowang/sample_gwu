!! NAME
!!
!!  op_setPEcoeffsAij4
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call op_setPEcoeffsAij4 ()
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  This routine sets the A(i,j,4) expansion coefficients for determining the
!!  photoelectric cross sections according to the F.Biggs and R.Lighthill report:
!!
!!       Analytical Approximations for X-Ray Cross Sections II
!!       Frank Biggs and Ruth Lighthill
!!       Weapons Effects Research Department
!!       Sandia Laboratories, December 1971
!!
!!  The data is NOT the updated data from the 1988 update of the report!
!!  This routine can only be called after all the necessary arrays have
!!  been allocated. It sets the coefficients in three separate routines.
!!  Providing only one routine to set the entire coefficients leads to
!!  exaggerated compilation times!
!!
